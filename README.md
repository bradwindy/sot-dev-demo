## Technologies

- #### React

  Web UI library that allows us to component-ise elements of our website to be reused with ease across multiple pages, such as the social media buttons on this site. It also allows for many modern methodologies of web development that we don't get into with this project.

- #### Next.js

  Front-end development web framework. It works on top of React, to include routing (having multiple website pages), and other goodies that make the website a faster and smoother experience compared to using straight React. Along with that, Next.js makes the project easier to deploy to a live site.

- #### React Bootstrap

  A CSS framework that gives us a bunch of great pre-done, reusable styling for React components, along with easy ways to make our website resposive to mobile devices.
